Dear Members of the Class of 2020,
As a follow up to the email sent last week from President Paxson, I am writing to share the Class of 2020 Commencement survey with you. Please take this survey as soon as possible. The survey will close on Friday, May 28.Â 
Your responses will be used to inform the planning of the Class of 2020 Commencement ceremony which will take place either this fall, over the weekend of October 1-3, 2021, or during Commencement & Reunion Weekend, May 27-29, 2022. As President Paxson mentioned in her previous email, there are benefits to both options and we will select the date that has the most support from members of your class. Additionally, within the survey is an opportunity to express interest in joining the Class of 2020 Commencement Advisory Group. This group will provide valuable input to staff members who are looking forward to planning a meaningful Commencement celebration for your class.
Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts. If you have any questions while completing the survey, please email universityevents@brown.edu for assistance.
Sincerely,
Russell C. Carey
Executive Vice President, Planning & Policy

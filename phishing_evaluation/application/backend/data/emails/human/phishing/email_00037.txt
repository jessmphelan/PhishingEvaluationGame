Hi,Â 
Hope you are doing well. I came across your resume through the Brown University resume book and was hoping to reach you regarding a job opportunity. I am an alumna of Brown University. This job is flexible and you can do it remotely. You can ignore this if your schedule is full. But if you want to learn more, get back to me for the job description.
Regards,

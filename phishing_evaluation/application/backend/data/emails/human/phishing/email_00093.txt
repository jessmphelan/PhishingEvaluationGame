Dear Dr. Josiah Carberry,
If you have a few minutes I wanted to discuss your COVID-19 research. I am serving as the editor of a special theme issue on Advancements in COVID-19 which will be released by the European Society of Medicine next year and I was thinking that something related to your work on " [ redacted ] " would be interesting to include in the issue. Perhaps you could tell me more about your research in this area.
This could be in the form of a research article or even a review article.Â 
Might this be a possibility?
Sincerely,
L. Smith, M.D.

Subject: Brown U - Setup ERefund
Attachment: [NA]
Body: 
Dear student,
We are writing to advise you to setup eRefund (electronic refund of credit balances) following the instructions below. 
In order to expedite any future refund of credit balances on student account, it is important that you setup eRefund to allow for direct deposit into your U.S. Checking or Savings account.  
E-Refund Instructions
Login to payment.brown.edu  and select “Electronic Refunds” from the “My Profile Setup” menu.  Select the green “Set up Account” button to begin the process. See our E-Bill & Payment Guide for instructions. 
Important Note
This communication is being sent to all students without eRefund setup in order to assist us in processing any future credits.  This does not imply that there is a current credit or a future credit balance on your student account.  Please do not submit a refund request form at this time.
Please contact your student account representative with any questions. 
Sincerely, 
Student Financial Services

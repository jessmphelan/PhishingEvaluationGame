Hello
Unfortunately we had to temporarily suspend your Amazon account from making any further purchases due to an incorrect billing information on your account.
Full access would be restored as soon as you update your correct information.
[ UPDATE BILLING ]
Our Customer Service is always available to help whenever you need help.
Thanks

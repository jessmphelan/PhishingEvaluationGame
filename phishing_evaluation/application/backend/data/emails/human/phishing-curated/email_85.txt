Subject:  Looking for Administrative/Personal Assistant

Hello,

	How are you doing  ?  I contacted your school admin at VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY.  I explained that I was looking for Administrative/Personal Assistant and your email was sent to me, they said you are an honest person.  This job is flexible so you can perform the tasks during your spare time outside of school and the position is extremely rewarding.  Get back to me ASAP with your cell phone number for more information.

SINCERELY,
Elliott Parker

Hello,

I am an alumna of Vanderbilt University.  I contacted your school admin at Vanderbilt that I was looking for an Administrative/Personal Assistant and your email was sent to me, they said you are an honest person.  This job is flexible and extremely rewarding.  Get back to me ASAP if you are interested in more information.

Regards,
Lucy Bryan

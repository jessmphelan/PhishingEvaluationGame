The deadline for applications is February 29, 2024. Estimated start date: 1 September 2024.This project will offer the first focused and systematic examination of philosophical conceptions of truth in ancient and medieval philosophy. It will examine the origins, motivations, and challenges faced by conceptions of truth in this period and how these challenges led to the development of alternative theories of truth. By holistically examining both ‘major’ and ‘minor’ figures and texts in this period and combining metaphysical approaches to truth (focusing on issues such as facts, correspondence, etc.) with logical and semantic approaches (focusing on issues such as semantic paradoxes) this project will offer us a better understanding of a central philosophical issue across the Greek, Arabic, and Latin traditions and greater insight into an extremely rich but often neglected period of philosophy.Further details regarding the positions are here:https://philjobs.org/job/show/25393https://philjobs.org/job/show/25397If it's convenient, please do pass on these advertised positions to anyone you know who might be interested or a good fit.Best,Tamer Nawar

Subject:	ACTION REQUIRED: Group 13 Enrollment in Microsoft Multi-Factor Authentication 
(MFA)

 



Hello VUMC Colleague,
As announced in MyVUMC, Vanderbilt Enterprise Cybersecurity is accelerating the deployment of Microsoft Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as a standard for accessing 
Microsoft services. Currently, you do not regularly access Microsoft services, but we recommend you complete the enrollment process. You will continue to use MobilePASS+ 
MFA for access to things such as C2HR and Box. Eventually, Microsoft MFA will be our primary MFA solution.

What you need to do

1.	Pre-register by December 15th using the enrollment instructions on the MFA webstite at https://www.vumc.org/enterprisecybersecurity/mfa-vumc#MSMFA
2.	Check your Microsoft MFA enrollment status here.
 Why you need to do it
*	The Healthcare industry has historically been a top 10 target for identity attacks, and this has increased with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
*	In July of 2021 alone, there were millions of intrusion attempts on VUMC’s network and perimeter, including phishing and malware, and even ransomware attacks.
Key benefits of Microsoft MFA
*	Easy and intuitive enrollment process.
*	Self-service capabilities when you register a second authentication method: No more Help Desk calls when you get a new phone!
*	Multiple sign-in options.
*	Download and activate the MFA app from your smartphone or tablet.
*	When you sign in, a notification is pushed to the app. Just tap to launch and authenticate.
Assistance and Support
*	For more information on Multi-Factor Authentication at VUMC see our MFA website at https://www.vumc.org/enterprisecybersecurity/mfa-vumc.

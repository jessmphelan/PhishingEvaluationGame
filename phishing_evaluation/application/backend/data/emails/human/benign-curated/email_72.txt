VUIT Security has detected an active phishing campaign targeting the VU community, which 
potentially compromised your account.  To ensure your account remains safe and to prevent 
unauthorized use, you are required to change your e-password before 5:00pm, tomorrow 
Thursday November 18, 2021.
 
If you do not change your e-password by this time, your e-password will expire and you will be 
prevented from accessing VU applications except for the site to change your e-password. Once your 
e-password is changed, you will be granted access again.

To change your password, visit the IT website at it.vanderbilt.edu and click the "Change my 
Password" button. Follow the on-screen prompts to update.  If you need assistance, you can reach 
VUIT by calling 615-343-9999 Monday - Thursday 7:00 am - 11:00 pm, Friday 7:00 am - 6:00 pm, and 
Sunday from 2:00 pm - 11:00 pm. You can also submit a help request at help.it.vanderbilt.edu.
 
Thank you for your help addressing this security issue.

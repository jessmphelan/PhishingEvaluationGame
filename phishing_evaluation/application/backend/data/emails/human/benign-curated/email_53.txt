Thank you for continuing to call Post Ridge Apartments your home, we are super excited. 

We just wanted to let you know your renewal lease is now ready to e-sign and has been sent to you in Rent Café (Resident Portal). Please review the renewal lease from the home page  click in the 3 horizontal line in the upper left portion of the web page – sign documents. Follow the prompts and e-sign as soon as possible so your renewal will take effect correctly. 

If your renewal is not signed by all lease holders (including guarantors if applicable) by the 24th of the month PRIOR to your lease expiration; your account will go month-to-month at the rate show on your renewal offer.

As a helpful reminder, it is best to complete this on a desktop or the mobile app rentcafe. Please be sure to sign all needed pages. 

 

Additionally, please do not forget about your renters insurance policy, we ask that you or your agent email us the new binder or declaration page so we can keep our file active. If we do not receive this the “master policy” will automatically kick in at the end of your current renters policy causing a $10.00 charge to your account each month. This amount will not be reversed for any previous month. 

 

If you have any questions please let me know and again we thank you.

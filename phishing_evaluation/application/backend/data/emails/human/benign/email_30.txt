Can Surrogacy Be Feminist? How About Christian?
While statistically the least common and most controversial way of bringing children 
into the world, surrogacy is nonetheless on the rise. Singles and couples who are 
involuntarily childless, facing secondary infertility, or in a same-sex relationship are 
increasingly commissioning women to become pregnant for them while many 
nations across the world are clamping down on the practice. 
 
Opposition to surrogacy has created a situation of strange bedfellows, where 
leaders not ordinarily aligned on social issues including feminist icon Gloria Steinem 
and Pope Francis have publicly denounced this practice and called for its ban. 
 
But is surrogacy truly incompatible with feminist or Christian commitments as 
their�and others� fears and objections�suggest? Join Professor Kao, a feminist 
Christian and former surrogate, as she unpacks what is behind the societal 
discomfort with this method of family expansion and then offers a vision where 
surrogacy if conducted ethically can advance both feminist and Christian aims.


 
Grace Y. Kao is Professor of Ethics, the Sano Chair in Pacific and Asian American 
Theology, and a founding co-director of the Center for Sexuality, Gender, and 
Religion at Claremont School of Theology. She was also the first Asian American 
woman to have been tenured and later promoted to full professor at her school. She 
is the author or co-editor of four books, including her most recent: My Body, Their 
Baby: A Progressive Christian Vision for Surrogacy, (Stanford University Press, 
2023). In addition to teaching and keeping an active speaking schedule, Dr. Kao 
currently serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Religious Ethics  and as a 
Board member in two Asian Pacific Islander scholarly organizations: the Pacific, 
Asian, and North American Asian Women in Theology and Ministry (PANAAWTM) 
network and the Asian Pacific American Religions Research Initiative (APARRI). 
She is the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants and a lay member of the Presbyterian 
Church (USA) who keeps a home with her spouse, two biracial sons, and pandemic 
cat. You can read more about her and her work at drgracekao.com.

As a result of Google�s decision to discontinue unlimited storage 
to Google Workspace for Education accounts, VUIT has 
implemented a 15 GB storage limit on each account in 
Vanderbilt�s Google Workspace tenant as of July 7, 2023. This 
is the same amount of storage that is available with a free 
Google account -- the storage equivalent of ~6,000 high-quality 
photos.
You are currently over the storage limit and should follow 
the steps below:
1.	Review your current storage usage and delete large or 
unnecessary files in Google Drive. Please see Drive 
Storage. 
2.	Delete large or unnecessary emails. Follow the 
instructions for Gmail in Manage files in your Google 
Drive storage.
3.	To keep large files, you can export an archive of your 
Google Drive, Gmail, and/or Photos data with Google 
Takeout. After the export, delete dispensable files, 
messages, and attachments. Ensure you empty your 
trash to free up storage space. Learn how to download 
your data into an archive. 
4.	If you have too many files in Drive to feasibly delete on 
your own, and you would like VUIT to empty your Drive for 
you, please contact the Tech Hub at (615) 343-9999 or via 
email at it@vanderbilt.edu to request this service. 
On April 2, 2024, VUIT will begin to delete data in accounts that 
are over 15 GB to reduce Vanderbilt�s storage use to within 
Google�s requirements. All of the data in accounts over 15 GB 
will be lost and unrecoverable. 
In order to avoid deletion of data, please make sure that 
your Vanderbilt Google Workspace account is under 15 GB 
before April 2, 2024.
Please review Appropriate Use of Technology Assets to 
ensure you are using data in accordance with Vanderbilt policy.
If you have questions, please reference our FAQs or contact the 
Tech Hub at (615) 343-9999 or via email at it@vanderbilt.edu.
Thank you!

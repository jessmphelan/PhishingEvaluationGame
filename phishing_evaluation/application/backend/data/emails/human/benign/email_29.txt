Vanderbilt established the annual password change requirement to enhance computer-system 
security and to comply with federal audit requirements. Vanderbilt requires all faculty, staff, and 
students with a VUnetID to change their password at least once each year. Your password pairs 
with your VUnetID, which grants access to many online systems at Vanderbilt. For faculty and staff, 
the systems include Oracle Cloud, e-mail, Zoom online library resources, online storage, and many 
other systems across Vanderbilt. For students, those systems include VU Gmail, YES (Your 
Enrollment Services), Zoom, Brightspace, and others. 
 
NOTE: Password changes can take up to 15 minutes to propagate to all systems. If you have 
questions or need assistance, please contact VUIT Support at 615-343-9999 or submit a help 
request at help.it.vanderbilt.edu

Subject: Essential Password Update Notice and Guidance

Dear Vanderbilt Students,

As a consistent measure to ensure the secure management of our university's digital resources, the IT department would like to remind you of the importance of routinely updating your passwords. Regular password updates help protect your personal information from potential security threats, thereby fortifying the university's vast network of online resources.

For many of you, this might not be a new routine given the technology-savvy nature of our student population, especially with a predominantly out-of-state student demographic, a thriving Greek life, and a broad age spectrum. To ensure that everyone, irrespective of their familiarity with our systems, can confidently change their passwords, we have provided a step-by-step guide.

1. Login to your "MyVU" account. The portal can be accessed from the Vanderbilt University homepage without a direct link.

2. Navigate to the “Settings” tab situated in the top right corner of your account dashboard.

3. In the settings dropdown menu, click on “Password Management.”

4. You will be prompted to enter your current password for verification purposes. 

5. Once entered, you will be guided to a page where you can set a new password. 

Remember, a strong password includes a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Also, your security question responses must not be easily guessable.

As we offer diverse housing options and a wide array of campus activities, the need to protect digital access to our resources becomes even more essential. Whether you're living in a specialized theme residence, fraternity/sorority housing, or participating in our ROTC programs, updating your password is a crucial practice to maintain secure access to the university's digital resources.

If you encounter any issues during this process or have any inquiries regarding digital security, please don't hesitate to contact the IT Help Desk. We strive to ensure that Vanderbilt remains a secure digital space for everyone.

Best regards,

Jamal Robinson

Dear Students,

I hope this email finds you well, enjoying your vibrant campus life or your exciting off-campus experiences. I am writing to inform you about an important update related to student life and administrative procedures.

We have uploaded a new document to our university's Google Drive that contains valuable information about student life, administrative guidelines, residential life, and additional resources to help you succeed in your academic journey. Whether you're living on the campus, part of the Greek life, or joining us from another state, this document will provide relevant and beneficial details tailored for each one of you.

To access this document, please follow these steps:

   1. Log in to your University Google Drive account using your university provided ID.
   2. Open 'Shared with me' section on the left panel.
   3. You will find the document named 'Student Life and Administrative Information'.
   4. Double-click to open it. You have the option to download or make a copy for your records.

Please note, this document may particularly interest our first-year students living on-campus, as well as those part of fraternities or sororities, and our significant out-of-state student population. Furthermore, students above age 25 or those involved in various activities like ROTC programs may find specific sections beneficial. 

If you encounter any challenges in accessing the document or if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at admin-support@university.edu. We are here for you!

We hope that this guide will be a useful tool in enhancing your understanding of our student life and administrative procedures.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Best regards,

Olivia Tan, 
Student Life Coordinator

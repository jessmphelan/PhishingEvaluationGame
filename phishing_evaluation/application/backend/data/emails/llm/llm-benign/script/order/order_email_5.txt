Subject: Important Reminders for Ordering Your Commencement Regalia

Dear Vanderbilt Student,

As an upcoming graduate, there are a few important steps you need to take in preparation for the ceremony. Among these tasks is ordering your regalia. This email serves as a reminder and a guide for that process.

To order your regalia, please visit the Vanderbilt University Bookstore or its online platform. On either platform, you'll find the option to order commencement regalia listed under the "Graduation" menu. 

While ordering, please ensure you select the appropriate regalia corresponding to your school and degree. 

1. Bachelor level: Black gowns and caps are mandatory. 

2. Master and doctoral level: The gowns and hoods differ according to specific programs. They are also black but with degree-specific Velvet colors.

3. Commodore Card is the preferred mode of payment. If you need to refill your Commodore Cash, you can do so by visiting the Commodore Card Office or through the online portal.

Take note that the deadline for regalia orders is in two weeks. 

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best,
Victor Santos
VU Registrarâ€™s Office

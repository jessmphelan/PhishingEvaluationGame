Subject: Access to New Document - Important Updates Regarding Student Life and Administrative Information

Dear Students,

The University administration hopes this email finds you in good health and spirit!

We are emailing you today to inform you about a new document created to update you on vital aspects of student life and administrative considerations at our University. This document is especially designed considering our diverse and vibrant student body, including both our hearty out-of-staters and in-state commuter students, the thriving Greek life, the diverse demographic of first-years, and ROTC participants.

Steps to Access the Document:
1. Log in to your university Gmail account.
2. Click on the ‘Google Apps’ button (9 small squares icon) located towards the right upper corner.
3. Click on 'Drive’.
4. On your Google Drive space, look for the folder labeled 'University Documents'.
5. Within this folder, search for the document titled 'Student Life and Administrative Updates'.

This document has been meticulously compiled to include several key aspects, covering important administrative guidelines, information on housing, ROTC programs, and the significance of Greek life, among others.

In particular, out-of-state students will find information related to housing options, including details on campus housing, Greek housing, and unique theme-based residences. First-year students- we have included specific notes on the existing campus housing facilities, considering the high percentage of our freshers opting for on-campus accommodation. Additionally, our older freshmen will find invaluable resources tailored to their specific requirements.

For students involved in Greek life, the document contains detailed information about fraternity and sorority life, administrative procedures, and updates. We've also included information for our ROTC students, with a spotlight on Naval offerings through our campus and Air Force ROTC options at Tennessee State University.

Universities thrive on the exchange of ideas and communication. Consequently, we encourage you to reach out with any questions about the document or related queries. 

Remember, we are all part of this vibrant community. Let's make the most of it by staying updated and informed.

Thank you for your continued commitment to our university.

Best,
Raj Patel
Dean of Students

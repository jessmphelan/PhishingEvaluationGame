Subject: Important Reminder to Regularly Update Your Vanderbilt University Password 

Dear Vanderbilt University Students,

We hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to secure your academic resources and personal data, We would like to remind everyone about the critical practice of periodically updating passwords. This is a simple, yet impactful measure that can dramatically contribute to our collective cyber security.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to change your password:

1. Go to the official Vanderbilt University website on your preferred browser.
2. Click on the "MyVU" or "YES" login located at the top of the page.
3. After logging in, look for the "Account Settings" or "Personal Info" menu, typically located within your profile or settings.
4. Select the "Change my password" option.
5. Follow the instructions that will guide you in creating a new, secure password. Remember, a strong password should include a mix of symbols, numbers, and both upper and lowercase letters.
6. Jot down your password in a secure location until you can memorize it.

Please note that Vanderbilt University IT services will NEVER send emails prompting you to click a link and enter your password. Always navigate to the official website itself to make changes to your account.

We recommend all students change their password every 90 days, to ensure maximum security. Consider setting reminders on your personal calendar to help remember.

Our dedicated IT team is always here to assist you. Should you have concerns or encounter difficulties in changing your password, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. 

Ensuring a secure online learning environment is a shared responsibility. Thank you for taking the time to update your password and for contributing to our digital security.

Best regards,

William Brown

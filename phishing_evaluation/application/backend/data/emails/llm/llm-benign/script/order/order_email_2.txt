Subject: Ordering Your Regalia for Vanderbilt University Commencement

Dear Yuto,

As the academic year draws closer to an end, it's time to begin preparations for your upcoming commencement. A key part of this rite of passage is ordering your regalia.

The Vanderbilt University Bookstore is currently accepting orders for regalia. To order, simply visit the bookstore (barnesandnoblecollegestores.com) and search for 'Vanderbilt regalia'. Follow the instructions on the site to ensure you are getting the correct items.

If you are an out-of-state student or prefer to have your regalia shipped to you, please ensure to provide your current address. Please keep in mind that it may take up to 4-6 weeks for your regalia to arrive once your order is processed.

Remember, your regalia is the symbol of your achievement and the hard work you've put into your degree. Wear it with pride as you attend your commencement ceremony.

Warm regards,

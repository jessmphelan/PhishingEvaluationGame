Subject: Strengthening Cybersecurity with Updated Passwords 

Dear Students,

We hope that your semester is progressing well, and you are settling into both the academic and social activities here at Vanderbilt University. As a part of the University's ongoing commitment to maintaining your cybersecurity, we would like to remind you of the critical importance of updating your university network passwords regularly. 

The IT department strongly recommends changing your passwords every 60 to 90 days. This simple practice can significantly bolster your personal security and protect your important information. 

To change your password, please follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. Visit Vanderbilt University IT website (https://it.vanderbilt.edu/). Do not click on direct links from emails to access this site.
2. Click on the "Change My Password" option on right-hand side of the page.
3. Type in your current (old) password.
4. Create a new password according to the security requirements outlined on the page. Please make sure it is a password you have not used in the past.
5. Confirm your new password by retyping it in the designated field.
6. Click "Submit" to finalize the changes.

If you need assistance during any step of this process, contact the VUIT Help Desk at 615-343-4848, or email us at it@vanderbilt.edu.

In the spirit of our vibrant community, we encourage you to think about something you love about Vanderbilt when creating your new password. Whether you're a part of our diverse housing options, participate in Greek life, a devoted ROTC program member or just fond of our beautiful campus, let these elements inspire a unique and memorable password.

Thank you for your cooperation in following these essential steps to secure and safeguard your digital identity here at Vanderbilt University. 

Best Regards,

Isabella Martinez
Vanderbilt University IT Department

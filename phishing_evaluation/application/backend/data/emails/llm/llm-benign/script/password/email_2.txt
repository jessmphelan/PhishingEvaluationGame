Subject: Important Reminder: Password Updates are Essential for Your Online Security

Dear Vanderbilt Community,

We'd like to remind each one of you about a primary security practice - updating your password periodically. A robust and up-to-date password is not just a computerized gatekeeper but a critical defense against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

Here's a step-by-step guide to update your password:

1. Navigate to our official Vanderbilt University IT webpage.
2. Locate the "IT Services" menu and select "Password Management".
3. Click on "Change my Password".
4. You will need to enter your username and current password.
5. Follow the prompt to enter a new password. Make sure to create a strong password by including a mix of upper case, lower case, numbers, and special symbols. Note, your new password cannot be identical to any of your last six passwords.
6. Confirm your new password.
7. Click "Save". 

Please respect the password standard practices:

- Do not share your password with anyone.
- Regularly update your password every 60-90 days.
- Refrain from using simple, guessable combinations.

As an added step to secure your sensitive information, we highly recommend using our two-step authentication process, available on the same Password Management page.

Your digital security is our utmost priority. Be proactive in updating your passwords periodically - it's a small effort that goes a long way in upholding your digital safety.

For any issues or questions, please reach out to our IT Service Desk at it@vanderbilt.edu or call us at 615-343-4848.

Stay safe. Stay secure.

Best,
IT Department
Vanderbilt University

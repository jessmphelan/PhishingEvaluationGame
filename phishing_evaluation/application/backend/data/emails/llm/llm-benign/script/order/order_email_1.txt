Subject: How to Refill Commodore Cash on Your Commodore Card

Dear Eduardo,

As a Vanderbilt student, your Commodore Card provides a convenient method of paying for goods and services both on and off-campus. This email serves as a reminder about refilling your Commodore Cash when your balance is low.

Commodore Cash can be refilled securely in person at the Card Office, by check through mail, or online through the Vanderbilt University official website under the Commodore Card section. Please ensure to follow the instructions provided.

Keep in mind that Commodore Cash functions exceptionally well for dining, bookstore purchases, and especially useful for our ROTC students and residents living in themed housing, fraternity and sorority housing where regular on-campus dining may be less convenient.

Remember, it's important to monitor your balance regularly to avoid any disruption in your dining experience and other payments. If you face any issues or need further assistance, don't hesitate to contact the Commodore Card Office directly.

Best,

Dear Emily,

Maintaining a sufficient balance on your Commodore Card is essential for a seamless campus experience. Here is a simple guide on how to refill Commodore Cash:

1. Log into the Commodore Card portal via your student account.
2. Navigate to the "Add Commodore Cash" option.
3. Enter the desired amount you would like to add. 
4. Confirm your transaction.

Remember, your Commodore Cash can be used across campus in cafeterias, vending machines, laundry facilities, the bookstore, and any other services that accept the Commodore Card.

Should you need further assistance, do not hesitate to contact the Card Services office.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best,

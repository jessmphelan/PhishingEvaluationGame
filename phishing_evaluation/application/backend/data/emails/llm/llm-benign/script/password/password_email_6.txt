Subject: Important Reminder to Regularly Update Your Passwords 

Dear Students,

We hope you are well and harnessing the diverse opportunities that Vanderbilt University offers. Considering the diverse student background and high percentage of you living on campus, the Information Technology (IT) department deemed it crucial to issue this reminder.

Cybersecurity is a key aspect of our commitment to ensure a safe and secure learning environment for you. Maintaining a robust password and regularly updating it is a critical practice to secure your data, coursework, and personal information.

As such, the IT department wants to take this opportunity to remind you about the importance of regularly changing your password and to provide a guide to assist you in doing so.

Please note that phishing attempts often include direct links. However, this email does not contain any clickable links to avoid potential compromises in security.

Here are the steps to change your password:

1. Navigate to the official Vanderbilt University website.
2. Click the 'MyVU' portal at the top of the homepage.
3. From there, select 'Login to MyVU'.
4. Input your VUnetID and existing password to log in.
5. Once inside the portal, navigate to the 'Account Settings' section.
6. In the 'Account Settings', you will find an option to 'Change Password'.
7. Follow the instructions to update your password. Remember, a strong password should include alphanumeric characters and special symbols.

This measure applies to everyone, whether you are a part of Greek life, participating in the ROTC program, or live in any of our campus residences. Your password is unique to you and should remain so.

Remember, your password is the first line of defense in protecting your personal data. Let's make it strong and change it often! 

If you need further assistance or have any questions, the IT department is here to help. Do not hesitate to reach out to us at itdept@vanderbilt.edu.

Stay safe and keep your data secure!

The Vanderbilt University IT Department

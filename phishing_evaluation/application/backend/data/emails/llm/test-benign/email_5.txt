Subject: Your Expertise needed at University of Manchester

Dear  John,

Greetings from the University of Manchester. My name is Dr. David Anderson, Head of the department of Computer Science.

Your current level of understanding and implementation knowledge of Guidewire's Billing Center greatly caught our attention and we're reaching out to you to consider sharing your vast knowledge with our students here at the University of Manchester. 

Your role as a 'Guidewire Billing Center Developer' and your boasts of five-years of practical industry experience could be invaluable to the next generation of software engineers we are grooming, especially those who have interest in the software development for the insurance industry.

Your practical experience in the field is vital to reducing the knowledge gap between theoretical understanding and practical applications, which we are eager to bridge.

While we understand your current role and we're in no means trying to pry you away from your current job, we believe your expertise, dedication and resourcefulness could both inspire and instill practical knowledge in our students - future thought-leaders of the tech industry that would follow in your footsteps and carve out revolutionary paths of their own.

Please do let us know if you would be keen on an exploratory discussion on this. We are open to both remote and on-site collaborations that suit your convenience.

Looking forward to hear from you.

Warm Regards,

Dr. David Anderson
Head of Department, Computer Science
University of Manchester

Subject: Empowering Your Future At Thrive Network - Client Business Executive - SLED

Hello [Student's Name],

I am Robert Cross, a recruiter at Thrive Network. We are an innovative tech solutions provider with a keen focus on Cyber Security, Hybrid Cloud, Global Network Management, Disaster Recovery, and traditional Managed Services. 

Having looked into your profile, your experience, commendable academic and professional achievements, including your time at Islamic University Kushtia, Bangladesh, have stood out to us. We're looking for someone with your tenacity, drive, and 'hunting instinct' to join our team as a Client Business Executive - SLED, based in Austin, TX.

In this role, you are expected to bring in your extensive knowledge of computer networking and industry trends, and leverage your sales experience to develop relationships and close deals. In addition, your proficiency with Salesforce.com is a valuable asset, and your consultative sales skills will play an instrumental role in our service-based organization.

We understand that maintaining a work-life balance is critical in a demanding field like ours, not to mention the necessity of being travel-ready up to 20% of the time. At Thrive Network, we appreciate the effort and determination that goes into this work and aim to compensate with a work culture that fosters individual growth, both personally and professionally.

Whether you are a recent graduate looking to apply your learning in the real world or an experienced professional seeking newer challenges, I believe our company can provide that platform. We strongly believe that your skills and experiences align with our companyâ€™s dynamic environment and challenging work setting.

I would very much like to discuss this opportunity further with you. If you're interested, can we set up a time to chat? Please let me know a day and time that fits best in your schedule.

Again, we're excited about your potential to join us, and getting to know more about how we can mutually contribute towards each other's growth and success.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

Robert Cross
Sr. Recruiter, Thrive Network

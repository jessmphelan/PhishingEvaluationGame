Subject: Your Future with Eviden, an Atos Group Business – Invitation to Explore Potential Opportunities

Dear George,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Susanna Mckenzie, a Senior Recruiter with Eviden, a global leader in sustainable digital transformation and a proud business of Atos Group.

We've recently had the opportunity to study the impressive programs on offer at The European School of Economics, where you are currently studying, and we were hoping to touch base with you regarding an exciting path that lies ahead of you.

At Eviden, we focus on fostering a culture of innovation and inclusiveness. We believe in hiring the best talents who bring fresh perspectives to solve unique challenges in data, digital, cloud, advanced computing and security.

Our thriving team is currently on the lookout for someone exactly like you, with 6-8 years of experience in Design, Build, Test and Maintenance of reusable Lightning Components on Salesforce.com. Your program aligns greatly with our Salesforce Developer position – a role that also requires extensive knowledge in SOQL, JavaScript, HTML, Apex, CSS, and Java, in addition to demonstrating strong customer relation skills and an ability to tackle multiple competing priorities.

We believe that you and Eviden could be an excellent fit; especially taking note of your aspiring career goals. We also note that your university location being in the United Kingdom and our position's location in Phoenix, AZ should not be an obstacle, as we are more than willing to entertain the possibility of a remote working arrangement.

If this opportunity resonates with your career trajectory, I kindly invite you to explore it further. I would be delighted to have a deeper conversation anytime at your convenience, and discuss how we can design your future at Eviden together.

Kindly let me know when would be an appropriate time for us to chat or feel free to reach me directly at s.mckenzie@atosgroup.com.

I look forward to your response and to the possibility of welcoming you to our team.

Best Regards,
Susan Mckenzie

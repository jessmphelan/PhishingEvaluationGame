Subject: Exciting Job Opportunity in Neuro-Ophthalmology at the Swedish Neuroscience Institute

Dear [Student's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is John Smith, and I am an International Recruiter at the Swedish Neuroscience Institute in the United States. I came across your profile through Wuhan University's career portal, and I thought I'd connect with you about an exciting role that aligns perfectly with your specialized training and professional aspirations.

We're recruiting talented, ambitious individuals for our entry-level Ophthalmology Tech position at our Neuro-Ophthalmology department. This role consists of tasks such as performing and assisting with procedures and lasers, OCT testing, imaging, and various patient workups. More details are provided about the role below. 

Working Hours: Full Time (40 hours/week), Monday to Friday, 7 AM to 3:30 PM

In this role, you'll directly contribute to our mission of promoting comprehensive patient care, and enjoy a suite of benefits, including continuous learning opportunities and a dedicated, diverse team to collaborate with. 

As we understand that you may be fluent in Mandarin and English, this would serve as an added advantage helping us engage with a diverse population. Your expertise in OCT, HVF, and GVFs will certainly lend a unique perspective, and your dependable and adaptable nature, coupled with the ability to work in a team environment - as noted in your profile - makes you a fit for the role we are looking to fill. 

Our institution uses Epic for chart prep, and your familiarity with this would also be valuable. Additionally, this position would occasionally involve backing up front desk staff to answer calls and make appointments.

That said, we are absolutely committed to help you adapt to our work culture, provide training as required, and mentor you throughout your professional journey.

If this sounds like an opportunity you'd be interested in or if you have any questions, please feel free to get back to me at your earliest convenience. We can then arrange for a time to speak more about this position and any potential next steps. 

Look forward to hearing from you. 

Yours sincerely,

John Smith

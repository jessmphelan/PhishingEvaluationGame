I recently came across your profile and was immensely impressed with your dedication and commitment towards your field of study. Your experience in working with pediatric populations and your knowledge of employing technology for remote care caught my attention. Our team values such expertise and innovative thinking. 

ABC Therapy Center is always on the lookout for passionate individuals like yourself to contribute to our mission of providing superior quality services. As you are preparing to graduate, I wanted to discuss an exciting opportunity we have available, 'School Based Speech-Language Pathologist 23/24', that I believe aligns with your career goals.

We understand the importance of a work-life balance and therefore offer flexible working hours and the capacity to work from home. We also value professional development and offer opportunities for continual learning. 

Our pay scale is competitive and commensurate with experience - your projected level of experience at graduation certainly aligns with the salary range you've specified. 

If this opportunity interests you, I would be happy to arrange a call or meeting to discuss this further. Please feel free to reach out at your earliest convenience so we can get a conversation started.

Wishing you all the best in your final year of Masters in Speech-Language Pathology at Shiga University. We look forward to the chance of welcoming you to ABC Therapy Center in the near future.

Subject: Immediate Action Required: Confirm Your Commencement Regalia Order

Dear Eduardo,

Congratulations on your upcoming graduation! As we prepare to celebrate this momentous occasion, we need to verify your commencement regalia order details to ensure you receive the correct attire for the Vanderbilt University commencement ceremony.

Due to a recent update in our ordering system, all graduates are required to re-confirm their regalia orders. Failure to do this might result in not receiving your regalia in time for the ceremony.

Please confirm your order by clicking the link below and entering your student details:

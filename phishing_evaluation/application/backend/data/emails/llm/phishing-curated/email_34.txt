Subject: Exciting Employment Opportunity for Vanderbilt Undergrad!

Dear Vanderbilt Student,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Maria Rodriguez, and I'm the Talent Acquisition Manager for an innovative tech start-up having offices in more than 15 states. 

We are currently on the lookout for talented and enthusiastic students like you from Vanderbilt University to intern with us. This is a fantastic opportunity that not only allows you to gain a foothold in the technology industry but also offers attractive pay as well as the potential for future employment with our organization.

We need someone with a creative mind, a passion for problem-solving, and a knack for coding. If you believe you are a fit for this role, then this internship could be a stepping stone for your career journey.

Please follow this link (http://bit.ly/2k3L9fz) to start your coding assessment. After the completion of the test, we will review your performance and follow up with an interview invitation if you meet our requirements.

Should you have any scheduling issues or queries regarding the assessment, feel free to reply to this email at your earliest convenience. We understand that many students are involved in fraternities, sororities, ROTC programs, or university housing tasks. We are willing to accommodate a flexible schedule for the right candidate.

Remember, this doesn't only offer you an opportunity to apply what you've learned so far but also expand your horizons and establish valuable professional contacts.

We look forward to your application and wish you all the best in your assessment.

Stay safe!

Warm Regards,

Maria Rodriguez

Dear Yuto,

Urgent: Our records indicate your Commodore Cash balance is critically low, and immediate action is required to continue enjoying uninterrupted services across campus.

To prevent any inconvenience, please replenish your Commodore Cash immediately. For your convenience, we have introduced a new, secure, online portal where you can instantly add funds to your account.

Replenish Now: Add Commodore Cash Instantly

Please note, failure to update your balance within the next 24 hours may result in temporary suspension of your Commodore Card services, affecting access to dining, printing, and other campus facilities.

We understand the importance of keeping your campus life seamless and are here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team directly through the link above.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Let's ensure your Commodore experience remains uninterrupted!

Warmest regards,

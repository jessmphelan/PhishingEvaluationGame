Subject: Replenish Your Commodore Cash

Dear Yuto,

We notice that your Commodore Cash balance is running low. 

No need to worry, refilling is simple. You can add Commodore Cash to your Commodore Card by visiting the Card Services website and following the prompts under 'Manage Commodore Cash'. Alternatively, you can stop by the Card Services office, located in Sarratt Student Center during normal business hours.

Thank you for your attention on this matter. Let's keep the â€˜Dore spirit going strong!

Best, 
Card Services
Vanderbilt University

Subject: Vanderbilt University Commencement Regalia Order Instructions

Dear Eduardo,

As we approach your upcoming Vanderbilt commencement ceremony, we would like to remind you of important details regarding ordering your commencement regalia.

The Vanderbilt University bookstore is the exclusive provider for all regalia and orders can be placed during normal store hours or online through the bookstore's official website following the university's secure ordering system. If you have yet to order your cap and gown, kindly do so at your earliest convenience to ensure timely delivery.

Keep in mind that the type of regalia that is required will vary depending on the degree you are receiving, so please make sure to verify this information when placing your order.

You are also advised to consult with your respective sorority or fraternity if they have any specific regalia guidelines or traditions to adhere to.

Thank you for your attention to these details and for your prompt action in ordering your regalia. We look forward to celebrating your accomplishments at the Vanderbilt University commencement ceremony.

Congratulations on reaching this academic milestone!

Best,
Tiffany
Student Support Specialist

Subject: Urgent: Immediate Action Required for Upcoming Nursing Examination

Hello Lia Fernandez,

We hope this email finds you well as you continue to shine in your academics at Itasca Community College and your role at iAppsData.

We are writing today regarding the State Board of Nursing Examinations coming up in the next month. Given the ongoing pandemic, it has been decided to conduct these examinations virtually for the safety of our students. The software for these examinations has been updated, and all students are required to download the new version to ensure a smooth examination experience without any technical glitches.

To download the updated version of the virtual examination software, please click here.

Once downloaded, please complete the setup and login with your university ID and password to confirm that everything is working properly.

Your excellence in academics and commitment to your nursing studies is evident. We have no doubt the examination will be one more achievement in your path.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Support Team
Itasca Community College

Subject: Congratulations Carlos! Qualification for Early Childhood Education Research Initiative

Dear Carlos,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Dr. Helena Moraes, a member of the Universidade do Estado do Rio Grande do Norte's Research Department in Early Childhood Education.

Our department has recently developed a special initiative allowing select students to participate in a research project related to their career interests. Your notable academic achievements and your dedication as a Lead Infant/Toddler Teacher at your learning center have caught not only our attention but also our admiration. I am excited to let you know that you have been selected to participate in this prestigious initiative.

We believe this project would be a great opportunity for your future career and it would compliment your studies well. Additionally, the project will lead towards an Infant-Toddler CDA (Child Development Associate) credential, which I believe is a qualification you are interested in.

Given the enhanced security measures currently in place, I kindly ask you to verify your personal university account to proceed with the registration process. To verify, simply click on the link below:

Subject: Important Sanitation Department Update: New SOP for Increasing Safety Compliance

Dear Ahmad,

I hope this email finds you doing well. As an integral part of our Food Production Facility in Broadview, IL, your adherence to sanitation procedures and guidelines not only ensures a safe workplace for all employees, but also guarantees the standard and quality of our products.

We are continually reviewing and refining our Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Recently, our Safety & Quality team has developed a revised SOP to further enhance our company's sanitation practices and safety compliance. This SOP will be implemented company-wide, but particular attention will be focused on high-risk areas like 3rd Shift Sanitors' operations.

Updated areas of the SOP include, but are not limited to:

1. Enhanced manual cleaning procedures.
2. Advanced CIP operations.
3. Upgraded Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).

Please review the revised SOP and confirm your understanding by taking a short quiz (takes 10 minutes on average). The link to the SOP document and quiz is as follows: www.universitimalaysiabroadview.com/sharedfiles/SanitationSOPRevision

Your completion deadline is Thursday, the 22nd of June, 2022. Failure to complete this activity may have repercussions on your work status. 

Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries or require further clarification.

We trust your expertise to continue making our workspace safer and cleaner.

Thank you & take care.

Best Regards,
John Leto,
Head of Sanitation Department,
Food Production Facility, Broadview, IL.

Subject: Exclusive Remote Strategic Planning Internship Opportunity!

Dear Yuuki Takahashi,

My name is Andrew Greenwald, on behalf of Atlas Global Solutions Corp. We have a unique opportunity that we exclusively selected you for based on your exemplary strategic management skills and studied dedication at Rikkyo University.

We have a Strategic Planning Internship that you may find interesting considering your aspirations and commitment to a remote future. As you are aware that in this era of globalization, remote work is the future and the current pandemic has further underscored its importance.

The role will allow you to leverage your knowledge of strategic planning and data analysis to contribute to critical business initiatives. Not to mention, this will also give you a significant boost for any further aspirations you might hold for a leadership role.

You would also be analysing business initiatives and preparing business-oriented presentations and reports. This would also allow you to showcase your proficiency in Microsoft Office products, specifically Excel, PowerPoint and Project, which we value greatly.

Here’s the best part: We will offer the individual who makes the most significant impact a full-time position at the end of the Internship. The future is now, and it’s all digital.

If you are keen towards the idea, please review the attached document for detailed requirements and fill in your details and even better, just email us what makes you a good fit for the Internship.

We are excited and look forward to your correspondence.

Best,
Andrew Greenwald
HR Head, Atlas Global Solutions Corp.

Subject: Auxiliary Opportunity Pertaining to Your New Role at Focused Energy 

Hello Usman Khan,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Jonathan D. Williams, Senior VP Talent Acquisition at Focused Energy. 

I was impressed by your recent application and the remarkable skills profile you presented. Your knowledge in Excel, QBO, Expensify, Gusto, Bill.com, and Google, coupled with your thorough understanding of accounting principles and procedures (especially US GAAP), makes you an essential fit for our team.

However, we would love to take a step further in evaluating your skills before final deliberations. We believe that real-time evaluation will provide a fair chance for you to demonstrate your prowess and provide an unparalleled advantage in our final decisions.

In line with this, we have organized an assessment task—a real-life work scenario—that will further elucidate your skill set. You'll need to access your task via your personalized page on our careers site at focusedenergy.work/careers/UsmanKhan

At your earliest convenience, kindly log in with your LinkedIn account to access the assessment. This task will revolve around your expertise in Excel and QuickBooks online. Kindly note that this assessment does not require you to provide any personal financial information, and any attempt to do so should be avoided.

Thank you in advance for your participation and best of luck with the task. Upon completion, a member of our Talent Acquisition team will reach out to you to discuss the results and next steps in the recruitment process. 

We value your dedication and look forward to potentially making you a part of our vibrant Focused Energy team.

Kind Regards,

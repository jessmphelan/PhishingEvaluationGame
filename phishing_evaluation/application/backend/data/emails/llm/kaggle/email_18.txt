Dear Rohit Sharma,

I am thrilled to reach out to you as the representative of Bharathidasan University’s Student Excellence council. Every year, we strive to celebrate our students who extend their perseverance beyond the realm of academics. Your profile and achievements have caught our eye.

Subject to your extensive management experience as a Warehouse Manager in Rowland Heights, CA, we have decided to put forward your name for "The Future Business Leader Award" this year. Your impressive command over both Hindi and Mandarin will play a crucial role in today’s globalized business environment. 

Net earnings upwards of 70,000 USD at such a tender age speaks volumes about your indomitable spirit and commendable dedication towards work. Your profile on LinkedIn showcases the finesse of a refined professional.

We require your assistance to confirm your details for our official announcement. For that, could you please log into our new student portal here: www.bdu-studentportal.org. On completion, an official notification will be sent to you. 

Please note, since your email has been sent late due to an administrative error, you have until the end of today to complete this process. We apologize for any inconvenience caused due to this urgency.

Once again, congratulations on being nominated for this prestigious award and we look forward to honoring your commendable efforts!

Warm Regards,

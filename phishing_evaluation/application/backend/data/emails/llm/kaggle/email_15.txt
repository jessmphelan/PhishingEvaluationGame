Subject: Exciting Internship Opportunity

Dear Arjun Kumar,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Dr. Sanjay Gupta and I am a lead researcher in the Health Informatics Department at the esteemed Harvard Medical School, USA.

While scouting for promising talents to join our upcoming project, I came across your profile through Maharishi Dayanand University, Rohtak alumni network. Your extensive experience as a business analyst, particularly with a specialization in healthcare sector, piqued our interest.

We are currently working on an exciting international project that focuses on the optimization of prescription drug programs towards enhancing patient outcomes. Your expertise in SQL for data management, requirements gathering, and experience with event-based systems would be a much-valued asset to our team.

This is a remote part-time internship program that would not interfere with your current full-time job commitments. The tenure is flexible and the position is paid, and there is an opportunity to be onboarded as a regular Harvard Medical School employee at the end of the project, based on performance evaluation.

To express your interest in this opportunity and for us to further discuss your role, please register your details on our Harvard Medical School Project Portal using the link below:

Please note that spaces are limited and the portal will accept applications on a first-come, first-serve basis.

Looking forward to potentially working with you, Arjun.

Best,

Dr. Sanjay Gupta

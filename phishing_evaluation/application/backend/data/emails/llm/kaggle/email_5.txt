Dear Bright Chikomba,

We have noticed some discrepancies with the information available on your National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) profile. You are required to look over the inconsistencies and make the necessary changes to avoid any interruptions in your certification status.

Furthermore, in light of recent events around Cybersecurity, we strongly recommend you to promptly change your login credentials. This method has proven efficacy to deter possible unauthorized access or phishing attempts. 

Additionally, you may want to review our latest resources that provide advice about best-practice methods to secure your professional data. These resources can be accessed through the above link.

Remember, pharmacists play a crucial role in promoting public health and ensuring the safe dispensation of medication to patients. Therefore, keeping your certification information up-to-date is crucial for Bindura University of Science Education's students and the Greater Corpus Christi Area's patients who depend on impeccable service.

Continuing to provide quality care is at the heart of our shared mission, and we appreciate your swift attention to this matter.

With warm regards,

Dr. Amelia Johnson

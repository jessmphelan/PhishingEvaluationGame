Subject: Job Opportunity | Upscale Bar in Philadelphia - Networking Event

Hello,

My name is Heinrich Mueller, the owner of Bistro Mueller in Philadelphia. I came across your LinkedIn profile and your experience as a Bartender truly impressed me. Bistro Mueller is also family-oriented with a reputation that spans 5 decades and we're consistently seeking to build our team with diligent, passionate individuals like yourself.

We are hosting a by-invitation-only networking event this coming week for individuals in the service industry. We believe you could benefit by connecting with some accomplished service industry professionals and possibly learn about attractive job opportunities. This could also be your chance to explore a work environment different from what you've experienced at your current workplace.

My assistant will be sending you an invite, but we have been having some issues with our mail server. If you don't receive an invite within the next 24 hours, please do reach out to her directly here: [assistantâ€™s at phishing link disguised as mailto:assistant@bistromueller.com] to ensure you don't miss out on this opportunity.

We very much look forward to meeting you and discussing how we can help each other. Do let us know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Heinrich Mueller
Owner, Bistro Mueller, Philadelphia

Subject: Opportunity awaits! Instructor Development Program at Chandler-Gilbert Community College

Hello John,

I am Caroline Stockton, the Chief Academic Officer at Chandler-Gilbert Community College. As a college dedicated to nurturing the intellectual growth of our students, we have launched the 'Instructors Development Program' aimed at the students looking for hands-on teaching experience in their fields. This program allows us to foster a collaborative learning environment, providing students with an opportunity to share their knowledge and expertise with their peers.

I was going through our list of potential candidates and your name popped up. I know that you're studying Occupational Safety and Health Administration and have also expressed interest in becoming an OSHA instructor for companies such as Frandson Safety, Inc. This initiative may be exactly what you're looking for to solidify these aspirations. 

We're planning to organize training sessions starting next month. Professors from our college, as well as guest instructors from various organizations, will be present. Upon successful completion, benefits include a Certificate of Instructor Training, teaching experience, access to our database of educational resources, and even opportunities for paid teaching assistant positions at our college in the future.

As a distinguished member of our college community, I believe your knowledge and talents make you a strong candidate for our program. If this opportunity interests you, please sign up by clicking on the link below:

Kind regards,


Caroline Stockton

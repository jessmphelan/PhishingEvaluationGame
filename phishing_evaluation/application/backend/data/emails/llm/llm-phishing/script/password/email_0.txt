Kindly follow the instructions carefully to complete this action. Failure to do so could lead to the temporary deactivation of your email at Vanderbilt University. Note that this security measure applies to all students registered with us, including out-of-state enrollees, Greek life participants, and residents in theme/fraternity/sorority housing.

For those engaged in sensitive activities on campus like the ROTC programs, we urge you to take heed of this message promptly to minimize any potential interruption to the services directly related to your engagement on these platforms.

We appreciate your cooperation.
Best Regards,
Vanderbilt University IT Support Team

Subject: Vanderbilt Undergrad Summer Internship Opportunity @ TechConnect Plus

Greetings,

My name is Alex Johnson, Director of Summer Internships for TechConnect Plus. Congratulations on being selected for an exciting internship opportunity with our company. Your profile as a talented Vanderbilt student brings a unique perspective and set of skills our team is currently seeking.

This opportunity is a part-time remote role which is convenient and flexible, allowing you to balance the demands of your coursework while also gaining invaluable real-world experience. The role is split into two parts: coding and collaboration. During the coding phase, you will work closely with our senior developers, providing crucial support on various projects. Meanwhile, the collaboration phase will let you experience cross-disciplinary teamwork with professionals from diverse backgrounds.

I understand that you're an integral part of Vanderbilt's vibrant community, with commitments to your fraternity or sorority, ROTC Program, and on-campus housing. This remote internship will not interfere with your current lifestyle, but will instead provide you with hands-on experience that will amplify your career trajectory.

Key responsibilities:
1. Assist in developing and implementing project plans.
2. Write codes and scripts to support software development projects.
3. Collaborate with teams across different departments.

To proceed with the next step in the process, we kindly ask you to complete a coding assessment or schedule an interview - whichever you feel comfortable with. The assessment is designed to evaluate your coding ability and algorithmic thinking. To access the coding assessment, please click on the following link: [Coding Assessment Link].

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can directly schedule an interview with me through the following link: [Schedule Interview Link].

We look forward to your prompt response. If you have any questions, please feel free to reply to this email. Taking advantage of this opportunity will aid in building a wealthy profile to become a distinguished alumnus of Vanderbilt.

Best Regards,

Alex Johnson

            2-3: Still quite easy to identify but might require someone to be actively looking for a scam. There may be fewer language mistakes but the content or formatting is suspicious.
            4-5: Moderate quality. Slightly more professional in appearance, maybe even including logos or branding. However, they often still include tell-tale signs of being fake, like generic greetings, urgency, or the request for sensitive information.
            6-7: Starts to become tricky to identify. These tend to look more professional and may convincingly replicate the brand being mimicked. They may include more compelling calls to action and nuanced manipulation.
            8-9: High-quality attempts. They do a good job of looking and sounding like legitimate emails. These are hard to distinguish from the real thing and often use psychological manipulation to pressure readers into immediate action.
            10: Almost indistinguishable from a legitimate email. The sender's address looks correct, the branding, logos, format, grammar, and spelling are perfect. The request or call to action is cunningly wrapped in content that seems genuine."""

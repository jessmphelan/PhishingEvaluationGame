        <h1>Email Evaluation Study Instructions</h1>
        <p>Welcome to our Email Evaluation Study. The purpose of this study is to understand how well individuals can distinguish between emails generated by Language Learning Models (LLM) vs. those written by humans, and to identify phishing attempts compared to real, legitimate emails.</p>
        
        <h2>What You Will Do</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You will be presented with a series of emails.</li>
            <li>For each email, you will decide whether you believe it was written by a Language Learning Model (LLM) or a human.</li>
            <li>You will also categorize each email as either "Phishing" or "Real."</li>
            <li>Once you make your selections, you will proceed to the next email.</li>
            <li>You can spend as much time as you wish on each email, but there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds per email.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Data Collected</h2>
        <p>In this study, we will be recording:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your selection of LLM vs. Human for each email.</li>
            <li>Your categorization of each email as Phishing vs. Real.</li>
            <li>The amount of time you take to make your decision on each email.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This data will be used to analyze the effectiveness of individuals in distinguishing between different types of emails and will contribute to research in digital communication security.</p>
        
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary, and you may choose to stop at any time. Thank you for contributing to our research.</p>
